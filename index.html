                <div class = "just_text">
                    <p> Thank you for taking the time to review my internal application for Fleming's winter 2023 nomination, to represent the school's submission for the Esri Canada 
                        GIS Scholarship Award. Since September 2022, I have had the distinguished pleasure of attending Fleming College's 
                        GIS Application Specialist program. Please enjoy this portfolio that highlights the involved courses, core competencies, key projects and my favourite moments. </p>
                    <p> The portfolio is categorized by the major program categories. Each section includes course names and core competencies. The core competencies come directly form
                        course outlines, but are condensed in some cases. Some listed projects will include a link to a GitHub Repository section where a version is available for download. 
                    <p> Special thanks to ESRI and ESRI Canada, as a significant portion of this was made possible by the ArcGIS Esri Suite, including ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS online.</p>
                    <p> An additional thanks to all the to the various team members that collaborated with me on various portfolio items. I had the opportunity to work with Some
                        gifted and wonderful people. I will be seeking their permission to include their names/credits where applicable within this portfolio, and updating as applicable.
                        In the interim, the number of additional team members that I worked with is included on projects as required.

                <h5>Course Highlights:</h5>
                <p>Creating field surveys, testing them in field, and performing ETL load workflows in SQL. Putting together the puzzle pieces of a relational database
                    is always a rewarding experience, but connecting the collection of survey data infield, to the output database, added an interesting dimension.  
                <p>This course was also my first introduction to the Structured Query Language (SQL), which has become a skill that continues to pay dividends. </p>

                <p>Building Extract Transform Load (ETL) workflows connecting spatial data to Esri geodatabases, using FME workbench has been a strong standout. I also
                    see the value in leveraging attribute rules and contingent values in ArcGIS Pro, and I'm interesting in exploring more what use-cases in 
                    which organizations have implemented these into their datasets.</p>

                <h5>Course Highlights:</h5>
                <p>There are few things I enjoy more than stretching my creative muscles. However, never completing any formal graphic design or art based courses before,
                    learning the visual frameworks involved in this course forced me to view the world around me from a brand new perspective. Experimenting with the Cindy
                    Brewer's ColorBrewer 2.0 was particularly interesting, and has become a go-to reference when designing and selecting colour palettes. 
                </p>
                <p>Yearning to explore a northern Ontario community that I have never been to, I focused my technical labs on the city of Whitehorse, Yukon. 
                    My favourite of these products being a 1:50,000 topographic map.</p> 
                <p>I was enjoy building my final project, in which I produced a 1:5,000 scale map illustrating the affect of structures damaged in the Nord-Kivu
                    province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, resulting from the Mt. Nyrigagongo eruption in 2021. This was also a great 
                    experience as it allowed me to link my current studies back to my master's program studying Disaster & Emergency Management, when I did a 
                    deep dive on an earlier eruption of the same volcano.</p>
                <p>A full size pdf of both the Yukon and the Mt. Nyrigagongo map are both available as full size PDFs in the GitHub repository.</p>

                <p>● Produced a 1:5,000, 22 x 36' scale map illustrating the impacts of the 2021 Nyrigagongo, focused on the city perimeter of Goma in the Nord-Kivu province</p>
                <p>● The intended audience for the map would be emergency management services and local community members, which is why a large map scale was selected</p>
                <p>● A focal element is a generalized lava flow map, and affected building structure. These products were derived from data made available through
                    UNITAR-UNOSAT and Sentinel-1 satellite imagery</p>
                <p>● Due to the nature of the hazard, contour lines were emphasized in 5 meter detail.</p>
                <p>● A 1:200,000 scale inset map with a local hillshade and the entire extent of the lava flow helps provide additional spatial context for the viewer </p>

                <h5>Course Highlights:</h5>
                <p> Despite my dreams to become a video game programmer in eight grade, I had no practical experience with any programming languages before beginning this program.
                     I now consider this programming course in it's entirety a highlight of the course, as I still have to pinch myself when reflecting how much I have learned. </p>
                <p> Nearly every new experience in Python trumped the last, starting with building my first 'Hello World' print statement, initiating my first for loop, reading and 
                    writing from a file, manipulating ArcGIS project data using ArcPy </p>
                 <p>The most interesting python programs included various iterations of a Hurricane Wind Speed calculator, as well as my team final project, developing an
                    app that calculates optimal apartment height for southern sunlight exposure for Canadian apartment seekers.

                <h5>Key Project Details:</h5>
                <p>● The Python program calculates the minimum required floor height for the apartment hunter, to prevent full shade at various times of year, 
                    given various user inputs</p>
                <p>● It also calculates statistical information about the amount of sunlight hours the user can expect to receive throughout the year</p>
                <p>● The resulting information is packaged into a feature class, a shapefile, and added to an ArcGIS Pro project</p>
                <p>● This project incorporates ArcPy, as well as other python concepts learned over the semester</p>
                <p>● Sunlight hour calculations are accurate within 30 minutes each day, with variance influenced by latitude. Optimal apartment height is based on receiving 
                    at least one hour of sunlight in a day. </p>

                   While there is still a lot to cover in the course, I have been enjoying building increasingly practical applications to list, describe and perform tasks with spatial data.</p> 
                <p>Creating readers to build geometries, feature classes and datasets is a strong example. Another highlight has been setting up 
                    Python Toolboxes for ArcGIS Pro. </p>

                <h5>Course Competencies:</h5>
    
                <p>● Compare and select the most appropriate data model and GIS analysis method for a given problem at an introductory level</p>
                <p>● Describe and perform basic GIS analysis with a variety of different data models using appropriate geoprocessing techniques</p>
                <p>● Develop work flows to accomplish specific objectives and tasks at an introductory level</p>
                <p>● Procure, interpret, transform, and integrate data from various sources, in different formats and coordinate systems, to solve spatial problems</p>
                <p>● Apply geoprocessing techniques using a model builder to solve spatial problems</p>

                <p>● Using professional and technical language of GIS describe how spatial analysis techniques can be used in industry</p>
         
                <h5>Course Highlights:</h5>
                <p> Few things feel as rewarding as successfully solving a problem. That is why each spatial analysis technique that I add 
                    to my professional toolbox makes me feel as though I'm walking a bit taller.</p>
                <p> Site suitability analyses were particularly rewarding experiences (cottage site suitability, wildlife habitat suitability, etc.), but the standout experience
                     of this course for me was building multi-criteria decision analysis to conduct a spatial based risk assessment. Due to my background in emergency 
                     management and business continuity, I am no stranger to risk analysis. However, I have never had the opportunity to use GIS technology to incorporate spatial 
                     factors into into my criteria weighting. Prior to beginning the program, this was the type of projects I envisioned myself working on. 
                </p>
                <p> This course was also my introduction to Esri's Model Builder functionality. Leveraging this toolset redefined how I use ArcGIS Pro, and has been beneficial 
                    in nearly every ArcGIS project I have completed since.

                <p>Remote sensing was one of the most challenging topics for me in the Fleming program. However, it was also
                    one of the most interesting topics, and is often what I would speak to when explaining to others what types of things
                    I was learning during my studies. </p>
                <p> Colour theory in particular was a particularly fascinating topic, as well as the application of indices with spectral signatures, 
                    such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). I also thoroughly enjoyed learning about the satellite systems that 
                    produce the aerial imagery</p>
                <p> Learning to geo-reference aerial imagery; and conducting image classification were delightful assignments. </p>

                <h5>Course Highlights:</h5>
                <p> Revisiting trigonometry for the first time since highschool was refreshing. This course also my first exposure to some of the basic geodesic concepts
                    that we would explore further in Geodesy. </p>
                <p> I also had my first opportunity to work with AutoCAD, after many years of hearing about it's use. I was fascinated by the level of detail possible
                    with this application, particularly the 3D Map extension.</p>

               <h5>Course Highlights:</h5>
               <p> My professor's patience and empathy as talked me out of my flat earth phase. Just kidding. Geodesy is a fascinating
                topic. The history of how the world has been measured over time, the geoid model of the earth as well the fundamentals about our global 
                navigation satellite systems are incredible topics that I recommend everyone take the time to learn more about.</p>
                <p> Diving into the details of map projections, datums and spatial references was especially useful, and has enabled make more 
                    well informed decisions moving forward. </p>

                <h5>Course Highlights:</h5>
                <p> In this condensed course we experimenting with spatial interpolation to model a Digital Elevation Map (DEM) and DEM derivatives, and building a hydrology model 
                    in ArcHydro using Ontario's Enhanced Flow Direction grid. Both projects are highlights of the entire program. It is a shame this course can't go on even longer, 
                    because environmental modelling is a real joy.
