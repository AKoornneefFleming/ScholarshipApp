            <h3>My Application</h3>
			<p>Thank you for taking the time to review my application. In 2022 and 2023, I have had the distinguished pleasure of attending Fleming College's 
                GIS Application Specialist - Online program. The last six months has been a fascinating journey, and I'd like 
                to take you over some of the hilights.</p>
            <p>For your consideration, I have built this portfolio to demonstrate some of the skills I have learned and the projects I have worked on. 
                The application is categorized by the major skills and competencies from the program. Each section includes descriptions and images 
                demonstrating some of the key projects I completed. Some listed projects will have an indication that they are available for download. 
                This can be accomplished by accessing the GitHub repository of the website, which is organized in the same fashion.</p>

Let's have a happy little tree in here. Anyone can paint. Learn when to stop. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things</p>
                <p>In your world you have total and absolute power. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. Very easy to work these to death. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Let's get crazy. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Isn't that fantastic? We'll put a happy little sky in here. It's all a game of angles.</p>

        <p>Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Just beat the devil out of it. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. That's crazy. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.</p>
        <p>This is the way you take out your flustrations. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.</p>
