                <div class = "just_text">
                    <p> Since September 2022, I have had the distinguished pleasure of attending Fleming College's 
                        GIS Application Specialist program. Please enjoy this portfolio that highlights the involved courses, core competencies, key projects and assignments that I worked
                        on, as well as my favourite moments. </p>
                    <p> The portfolio is divided into several categories, each with their own courses. The core competencies come directly form course outlines, but are condensed versions in some cases. 
                        Most listed projects will include a link to a section of my GitHub repository, where a version is available for download. This website was developed with the support
                        of W3school's various tutorials and samples.</p>
                    <p> Special thanks to Esri and Esri Canada, as a significant portion of my learning leveraged the Esri suite of products, including ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS online.</p>
                    <p> An additional thanks to all the to the various team members that collaborated with me on various portfolio items, and the staff and faculty that made This

                <h5>Course Highlights:</h5>
                <p>Creating field surveys, testing them in field, and performing ETL load workflows in SQL. Putting together the puzzle pieces of a relational database
                    is a rewarding experience, but using data the class collected ourselves infield, added an interesting dimension.  
                <p>This course was my first introduction to the Structured Query Language (SQL), which has become a programming language that I enjoy, and a skill that 
                    continues to pay dividends. </p>

                    see the value in leveraging attribute rules and contingent values in ArcGIS Pro, and I'm interesting in exploring more what use-cases in 
                    which organizations have implemented these into their datasets.</p>

                <h5>Course Highlights:</h5>
                <p>There are few things I enjoy more than stretching my creative muscles. However, never completing any formal graphic design or art based courses before,
                    learning the visual frameworks involved in this course forced me to view the world around me from a brand new perspective. Experimenting with the Cindy
                    Brewer's ColorBrewer 2.0 was particularly interesting, and has become a go-to reference when designing and selecting colour palettes. 
                </p>
                <p>Yearning to explore a northern Ontario community that I have never been to, I focused my technical labs on the city of Whitehorse, Yukon. 
                    My favourite of these products being a 1:50,000 topographic map.</p> 
                <p>I also enjoyed building my final project, in which I produced a 1:5,000 scale map illustrating the affect of structures damaged in the Nord-Kivu
                    province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, resulting from the Mt. Nyrigagongo eruption in 2021. This was also a great 
                    experience as it allowed me to link my current studies back to my master's program studying Disaster & Emergency Management, when I did a 
                    deep dive on an earlier eruption of the same volcano.</p>
                <p>A full size pdf of both the Yukon and the Mt. Nyrigagongo map are both available as full size PDFs in the GitHub repository.</p>

                <h5>Key Project Details:</h5>
                <p>● Produced a 1:5,000, 22 x 36' scale map illustrating the impacts of the 2021 Nyrigagongo, focused on the city perimeter of Goma in the Nord-Kivu province</p>
                <p>● The intended audience for the map is emergency management services and local community members, which is why a large map scale was selected</p>
                <p>● The focal element is the generalized outline of the lava flow approaching the city perimeter, intersected with the affected roads and building structures. 
                    These products were derived from data made available through UNITAR-UNOSAT and Sentinel-1 satellite imagery</p>
                <p>● Due to the nature of the hazard, contour lines were emphasized in 5 meter detail</p>
                <p>● A smaller scale inset map displays the entire extent of the lava flow over a hillshade, and helps contextualizes the spatial reference for the viewer </p>
                <p>● This was an individual project, with direct feedback and guidance provided by my professor</p>

                <h5>Course Highlights:</h5>
                <p> Despite my dreams to become a video game programmer in eight grade, I had no practical experience with any programming languages before beginning this program.
                     I now consider this programming course in it's entirety a highlight of the program. I still have to pinch myself when reflecting how much I have learned. </p>
                <p> Nearly every new experience in Python trumped the last, starting with building my first 'Hello World' print statement, initiating my first for loop, reading and 
                    writing from a file, and manipulating ArcGIS project data using ArcPy. </p>
                 <p>The most interesting programs included various iterations of a hurricane wind speed calculator, drawing images through the use of object class methods, codes that
                    solved basic trigonometric problems, and my team's self directed final project.

                <p>● Collaboratively designed and wrote a python program that calculates the minimum required floor height for an apartment hunter, to prevent full shade at various times of year, 
                    given various user inputs</p>
                <p>● It also calculates statistical information about the amount of sunlight hours the user can expect to receive throughout the year</p>
                <p>● The resulting information is packaged into a feature class, a shapefile, and added to the geodatabase of an ArcGIS Pro project</p>
                <p>● This project incorporates ArcPy, as well as other python concepts learned over the semester</p>
                <p>● Sunlight hour calculations are accurate within 30 minutes each day, with variance influenced by latitude. Optimal apartment height is based on the potential of
                     receiving at least one hour of southern sunlight in a day. City inputs as an alternative to latitude and longitude are only available for major Canadian cities. </p>

                <h5>Course Competencies:</h5>
    
                <p>● Compare and select the most appropriate data model and GIS analysis method for a problem</p>
                <p>● Describe and perform basic GIS analysis with a variety of different data models</p>
                <p>● Develop work flows to accomplish specific objectives and tasks at an introductory level</p>
                <p>● Procure, interpret, transform, and integrate data from various sources, in different formats and coordinate systems, to solve spatial problems</p>
                <p>● Apply geoprocessing techniques using a model builder to solve spatial problems</p>

                <h5>Course Highlights:</h5>
                <p> Few things feel as rewarding as successfully solving a problem. That is why each spatial analysis technique that I add 
                    to my professional toolbox makes me feel as though I'm walking a bit taller.</p>
                <p> Site suitability analyses were particularly rewarding experiences (cottage site suitability, wildlife habitat suitability, etc.), but the standout experience
                     of this course for me was building multi-criteria decision analysis to conduct a spatial based risk assessment. I have completed many risk assessments before. 
                     However, I have never had the opportunity to use GIS technology to incorporate spatial factors into into my criteria. 
                     Prior to beginning the program, this was the type of project that I envisioned myself working on. 
                </p>
                <p> This course was also my introduction to Esri's Model Builder functionality. Leveraging this toolset redefined how I use ArcGIS Pro, and has been beneficial 
                    in nearly every ArcGIS project I have completed since.

                <p> Colour theory in particular was a particularly fascinating topic, as well as the application of indices with spectral signatures, 
                    such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). I also thoroughly enjoyed learning about the satellite systems that 
                    are the basis for imagery products used during the course</p>
                <p> Learning to geo-reference aerial imagery; and conducting image classification were delightful assignments. </p>

                <h5>Course Highlights:</h5>
                <p> Revisiting trigonometry for the first time since highschool was refreshing. This course was my first exposure to some of the basic geodesic concepts
                    that we would explore further in the Geodesy course, and that are always a fascinating topic. </p>
                <p> I also had my first opportunity to work with AutoCAD, after many years of hearing about it's use. I was fascinated by the level of detail that is possible
                    to achieve with this software, particularly the 3D Map extension.</p>

               <h5>Course Highlights:</h5>
               <p> My professor's patience and empathy as talked me out of my flat earth phase was noteworthy. Just kidding. Geodesy is a fascinating
                topic. The history of how the world has been measured over time, the geoid model of the earth as well the fundamentals about our global 
                navigation satellite systems are incredible topics that I recommend everyone take the time to learn more about.</p>
                <p> Diving into the details of map projections, datums and spatial references was especially useful, and has enabled make more 
                    well informed decisions moving forward. </p>
